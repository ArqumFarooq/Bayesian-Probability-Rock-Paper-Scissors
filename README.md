# Bayesian-Probability-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Paper, Rock, Scissors is an ancient game that exists in many countries under many different names. While game theorists showed that everyone playing the game rationally should play as randomly as possible(select paper, rock, and scissors each with 1/3 probability), people are terrible random number generators. If a person makes a sequence of random numbers, then conditioning a number in the sequence based on a few of the past numbers often reveals a pattern that is not random! That is, the computer can predict the next move of an opponent after watching them play for several rounds, keeping track of subsequences of choices.
